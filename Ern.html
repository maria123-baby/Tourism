                  <p>Paniyeli Poru is 55 km from Kochi, India. It is an ideal location for one-day trekking. This 1.5 km
                     trekking through riverside pathway will take you to the waterfalls. After walking around 400 m one has
                      to cross the river by foot to reach the forest and walk forward about a kilometer to reach the cascade. 
                      You can also see numerous small islands in the river and you can hang out and roam around the jungle. 
                      It is not a hard trek and is easy when the water is low. You can spend the time on the banks of the
                       Periyar River enjoying the tranquility. During the summer, the area around Poru is very cool and refreshing. 
                       You can walk around the banks and can go half way across the river by walking on the tops of rocks.This is
                        a good scenic photography location.</p>
