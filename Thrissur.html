                  <p>Located 60 km from the Thrissur district of Kerala, Athirapally Falls is a marvellous cascade of frothy
                     waters that makes its way from the Anamudi mountains of the Western Ghats. Also called as Bahubali Waterfall, 
                     this 80 ft high and 330 ft wide marvel is the largest waterfall in Kerala. It is often referred to as the 
                     "Niagara Falls of India". From here, the Athirapally falls flows through the verdant greenery of Vazhachal Forest
                      toward the Arabian Sea, creating a spectacular vista of scintillating water, emerald jungles and azure sky.
